DESCRIPTION
    Generate PyMOL visualization files for viewing cavities and pockets in
    macromolecules including proteins and nucleic acids.

    The supported input file format are: PDB (.pdb), CIF (.cif)

    The supported output file formats are: PyMOL script file (.pml), PyMOL
    session file (.pse)

    A variety of PyMOL groups and objects may be created for visualization
    of cavities and pockets in macromolecules. These groups and objects
    correspond to complexes, surfaces, chains, ligands, inorganics,
    cavities, and pockets. A complete hierarchy of all possible PyMOL groups
    and objects is shown below:

    The hydrophobic and electrostatic surfaces are not created for complete
    complex and chain complex in input file(s) by default. A word to the
    wise: The creation of surface objects may slow down loading of PML file
    and generation of PSE file, based on the size of input complexes. The
    generation of PSE file may also fail.

OPTIONS
    -a, --align <yes or no> [default: no]
        Align input files to a reference file before visualization.

    --alignMethod <align, cealign, super> [default: super]
        Alignment methodology to use for aligning input files to a reference
        file.

    --alignMode <FirstChain or Complex> [default: FirstChain]
        Portion of input and reference files to use for spatial alignment of
        input files against reference file. Possible values: FirstChain or
        Complex.

        The FirstChain mode allows alignment of the first chain in each
        input file to the first chain in the reference file along with
        moving the rest of the complex to coordinate space of the reference
        file. The complete complex in each input file is aligned to the
        complete complex in reference file for the Complex mode.

    --alignRefFile <filename> [default: FirstInputFile]
        Reference input file name. The default is to use the first input
        file name specified using '-i, --infiles' option.

    --allowEmptyObjects <yes or no> [default: no]
        Allow creation of empty PyMOL objects corresponding to solvent and
        inorganic atom selections across chains and ligands in input
        file(s). By default, the empty objects are marked for deletion.

    --cavityCulled <Yes or No> [default: Yes]
        Cull cavities and pockets. The cavities and pockets are culled by
        default. This value is used to set of PyMOL parameter
        surface_cavity_mode as shown below:

            Yes: 1 (Cavities and Pockets Only)
            No: 2 (Cavities and Pockets Culled)

    --cavityCullSize <number> [default: 2.0]
        Approximate dimension of the cavity in Angstroms for detecting
        cavities and pockets in the interior of a macromolecule. The higher
        value makes PyMOL less sensitive to detection of smaller cavities.

    --cavityCutoff <number> [default: 3.0]
        Cavity cutoff in terms of number of solvent radii for detecting
        cavities and pockets. This value is used to set value of PyMOL
        parameter surface_cavity_cutoff.

    --cavityRadius <number> [default: 5.0]
        Cavity detection radius in terms of number of solvent radii for
        detecting cavities and pockets. The detection of larger pockets is
        ignored for lower value for the cavity radius. This value is used to
        set of PyMOL parameter surface_cavity_radius.

    -c, --chainIDs <First, All or ID1,ID2...> [default: First]
        List of chain IDs to use for visualizing macromolecules. Possible
        values: First, All, or a comma delimited list of chain IDs. The
        default is to use the chain ID for the first chain in each input
        file.

    -e, --examples
        Print examples.

    -h, --help
        Print this help message.

    -i, --infiles <infile1,infile2,infile3...>
        Input file names.

    --labelFontID <number> [default: 7]
        Font ID for drawing labels. Default: 7 (Sans Bold). Valid values: 5
        to 16. The specified value must be a valid PyMOL font ID. No
        validation is performed. The complete lists of valid font IDs is
        available at: pymolwiki.org/index.php/Label_font_id. Examples: 5 -
        Sans; 7 - Sans Bold; 9 - Serif; 10 - Serif Bold.

    -l, --ligandIDs <Largest, All or ID1,ID2...> [default: All]
        List of ligand IDs to show in chains during visualizing of cavities
        in macromolecules. Possible values: Largest, All, or a comma
        delimited list of ligand IDs. The default is to show all ligands
        present in all or specified chains in each input file.

        Ligands are identified using organic selection operator available in
        PyMOL. It'll also identify buffer molecules as ligands. The largest
        ligand contains the highest number of heavy atoms.

    -o, --outfile <outfile>
        Output file name.

    -p, --PMLOut <yes or no> [default: yes]
        Save PML file during generation of PSE file.

    -r, --residueTypes <Type,Color,ResNames,...> [default: auto]
        Residue types, colors, and names to generate for residue groups
        during '--residueTypesChain' option. It is only valid for amino
        acids.

        It is a triplet of comma delimited list of amino acid residues type,
        residues color, and a space delimited list three letter residue
        names.

        The default values for residue type, color, and name triplets are
        shown below:

            Aromatic,brightorange,HIS PHE TRP TYR,
            Hydrophobic,orange,ALA GLY VAL LEU ILE PRO MET,
            Polar,palegreen,ASN GLN SER THR CYS,
            Positively_Charged,marine,ARG LYS,
            Negatively_Charged,red,ASP GLU

        The color name must be a valid PyMOL name. No validation is
        performed. An amino acid name may appear across multiple residue
        types. All other residues are grouped under 'Other'.

    --residueTypesChain <yes or no> [default: auto]
        Chain residue types. The residue groups are generated using residue
        types, colors, and names specified by '--residueTypes' option. It is
        only valid for amino acids. By default, the residue type groups are
        automatically created for chains containing amino acids and skipped
        for chains only containing nucleic acids.

    --surfaceChain <yes or no> [default: auto]
        Surfaces around individual chain colored by hydrophobicity alone and
        both hydrophobicity and charge. The hydrophobicity surface is
        colored at residue level using Eisenberg hydrophobicity scale for
        residues and color gradient specified by '--surfaceColorPalette'
        option. The hydrophobicity and charge surface is colored [ Ref 140 ]
        at atom level using colors specified for groups of atoms by
        '--surfaceAtomTypesColors' option. This scheme allows simultaneous
        mapping of hyrophobicity and charge values on the surfaces.

        This option is only valid for amino acids. By default, both surfaces
        are automatically created for chains containing amino acids and
        skipped for chains containing only nucleic acids.

        In addition, generic surfaces colored by '--surfaceColor' are always
        created for chain residues containing amino acids and nucleic acids.

    --surfaceChainElectrostatics <yes or no> [default: no]
        Vacuum electrostatics contact potential surface around individual
        chain. A word to the wise from PyMOL documentation: The computed
        protein contact potentials are only qualitatively useful, due to
        short cutoffs, truncation, and lack of solvent "screening".

        This option is only valid for amino acids. By default, the
        electrostatics surface is automatically created for chains
        containing amino acids and skipped for chains containing only
        nucleic acids.

    --surfaceChainComplex <yes or no> [default: no]
        Hydrophobic surface around chain complex. The surface is colored by
        hydrophobicity. It is only valid for amino acids.

    --surfaceComplex <yes or no> [default: no]
        Hydrophobic surface around complete complex. The surface is colored
        by hydrophobicity. It is only valid for amino acids.

    --surfaceAtomTypesColors <ColorType,ColorSpec,...> [default: auto]
        Atom colors for generating surfaces colored by hyrophobicity and
        charge around chains and pockets in proteins. It's a pairwise comma
        delimited list of atom color type and color specification for goups
        of atoms.

        The default values for color types [ Ref 140 ] along wth color
        specifications are shown below:

            HydrophobicAtomsColor, yellow,
            NegativelyChargedAtomsColor, red,
            PositivelyChargedAtomsColor, blue,
            OtherAtomsColor, gray90

        The color names must be valid PyMOL names.

        The color values may also be specified as space delimited RGB
        triplets:

            HydrophobicAtomsColor, 0.95 0.78 0.0,
            NegativelyChargedAtomsColor, 1.0 0.4 0.4,
            PositivelyChargedAtomsColor, 0.2 0.5 0.8,
            OtherAtomsColor, 0.95 0.95 0.95

    --surfaceColors <ColorName1,ColorName2> [default: salmon,lightblue]
        Color names for surfaces around cavities and chains. These colors
        are not used for surfaces and cavities colored by hydrophobicity and
        charge. The color names must be valid PyMOL names.

    --surfaceColorPalette <RedToWhite or WhiteToGreen> [default: RedToWhite]
        Color palette for hydrophobic surfaces around chains and pockets in
        proteins. Possible values: RedToWhite or WhiteToGreen from most
        hydrophobic amino acid to least hydrophobic. The colors values for
        amino acids are taken from color_h script available as part of the
        Script Library at PyMOL Wiki.

    --surfaceTransparency <number> [default: 0.25]
        Surface transparency for molecular surfaces.

    --overwrite
        Overwrite existing files.

    -w, --workingdir <dir>
        Location of working directory which defaults to the current
        directory.
