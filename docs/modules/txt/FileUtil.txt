NAME
    FileUtil

SYNOPSIS
    use FileUtil;

    use FileUtil qw(:all);

DESCRIPTION
    FileUtil module provides the following functions:

    CheckFileType, ConvertCygwinPath, ExpandFileNames,
    FileModificationTimeAndDate, FileSize, FormatFileSize,
    FormattedFileModificationTimeAndDate, GetMayaChemToolsLibDirName,
    GetUsageFromPod, ParseFileName

FUNCTIONS
    CheckFileType
            $Status = CheckFileType($FileName, $FileExts);

        Based on *FileExts*, decides type of *FileName* and return 1 or 0.

    ConvertCygwinPath
            $NewPath = ConvertCygwinPath($Path);

        Check to see whether *Path* contains any Cygwin drive specification
        and convert it into Windows path.

    ExpandFileNames
            @FilesList = ExpandFileNames(\@Files, $FileExts);
            @FilesList = ExpandFileNames(\@Files, $FileExts, $IncludeDirName);

        For each directory name or wild card file name in *Files*, generate
        all file names which correspond to the specification along with
        match to any extensions in *FileExts* and return an array FileList
        containing these file names and other names. *IncludeDirName*
        controls controls whether directory prefixes are included in
        expanded file names. Default is to always append directory name
        before expanded file name.

        Notes:

            . Multiple file extensions are delimited by spaces.
            . Wild card, *, is supported in directory and file names along with file
              extensions.
            . For a specified directory name in the files list, all the files in the
              directory are retrieved using Perl opendir function and files filtered using file
              extensions. The file names "." and ".." returned by opendir are ignored.
            . For file names containing wild cards with and without any explicit file
              extension specification in the file name, all the files in the directory are retrieved
              using Perl opendir function and files filtered using file name along with any
              file extension. The file names "." and ".." returned by opendir are ignored.

    FormattedFileModificationTimeAndDate
            ($TimeString, $DateString) =
                 FormattedFileModificationTimeAndDate($FileName);

        Returns a formatted time and date string corresponding to *FileName*
        modification time.

    FileModificationTimeAndDate
            ($Hours, $Mins, $Secs, $DayName, $MonthName, $Month, $Year) =
                 FileModificationTimeAndDate($FileName);

        Returns file modification time and date values for specified
        *FileName*.

    FormatFileSize
            $FormattedSize= FormatFileSize($Size, [$Precision]);

        Formats the file size in bytes to human readable value and returns a
        formatted file size string.

    FileSize
            $Size= FileSize($FileName);

        Returns size of *FileName* in bytes

    GetMayaChemToolsLibDirName
            $MayaChemToolsLibDir = GetMayaChemToolsLibDirName();

        Returns MayaChemTools lib directory name by parsing INC values to
        extract MAYACHEMTOOLS/lib directory location: first entry in INC
        path should contain MayaChemTools lib location.

    GetUsageFromPod
            $ScriptUsage = GetUsageFromPod($AbsoluteScriptPath);

        Generates a ScriptUsage string from pod documentation in the script
        file using pod2text or perdoc.bat Perl utitities.

    ParseFileName
            ($FileDir, $FileName, $FileExt) = ParseFileName($FullFileName);

        Splits *FullFileName* into directory name, file name, and extension.
        FileDir is set to current directory for absent directory name in
        *FullFileName*. And *FileExt* is set to NULL string for
        *FullFileName* without any extension.

        This function doesn't perform checking ragarding the presence of the
        directory *FileDir* and *FullFileName* and the *FullFileName*
        without any extension is assumed to be a file instead of a
        directory.
