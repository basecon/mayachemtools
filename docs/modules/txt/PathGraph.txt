NAME
    PathGraph

SYNOPSIS
    use Graph::PathGraph;

    use Graph::PathGraph qw(:all);

DESCRIPTION
    PathGraph class provides the following methods:

    new, CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths,
    DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan, GetCyclicPaths, GetPaths, IsPathGraph,
    StringifyPathGraph

    PathGraph class is derived from *Graph* class.

  METHODS
    new
            $NewPathGraph = new Graph::PathGraph($Graph);

        Using specified *Graph*, new method creates a new PathGraph object
        and returns newly created PathGraph object.

        *Graph* is converted into a PathGraph by copying all its vertices
        and edges without any associated properties data and associating a
        *Path* object to each edge containing edge vertex IDs as intial
        path.

    CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths
            $PathGraph->CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths($VertexID);

        Collapses paths around a *VertexID* by updating paths around the
        vertex [Ref 31] and associating any resulting cyclic paths to graph
        as CyclicPaths property name. And returns *PathGraph*.

    DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan
            $Return = $PathGraph->DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan($Degree);

        Deletes vertices with degree less than *Degree* from *PathGraph* and
        returns *PathGraph*.

    GetCyclicPaths
            @CyclicPaths = $PathGraph->GetCyclicPaths();
            $NumOfPaths = $PathGraph->GetCyclicPaths();

        Returns an array of cyclic *Paths* associated with edges in
        *PathGraph*. In scalar context, number of cyclic paths is returned.

    GetPaths
            @Paths = $PathGraph->GetPaths();
            $NumOfPaths = $PathGraph->GetPaths();

        Returns an array of *Paths* associated with edges in *PathGraph*. In
        scalar context, number of paths is returned.

    IsPathGraph
            $Status = Graph::PathGraph::IsPathGraph($Object);

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether *Object* is a PathGraph object.

    StringifyPathGraph
            $String = $PathGraph->StringifyPathGraph();

        Returns a string containing information about traversed paths in
        *PathGraph* object.
