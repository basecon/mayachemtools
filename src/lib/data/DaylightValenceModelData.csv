# Original data source:
#     o Data extracted from Daylight theory manual and other on-line resources
#
# Notes:
#     o Formal charge and common valence information is used to calculate the
#       number of implicit hydrogens for Daylight valence model during
#       processing of SMILES strings
#     o Used for elements defined outside the brackets: Implicit hydrogens count
#       is 0 for elements inside the brackets unless it's specified in the SMILES
#     o Common valence is undefined for elements specified using * outside the
#       brackets
