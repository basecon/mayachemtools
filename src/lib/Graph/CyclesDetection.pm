=head1 NAME

CyclesDetection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Graph::CyclesDetection;

use Graph::CyclesDetection qw(:all);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<CyclesDetection> class provides the following methods:

new, Copy, DetectCycles, DetectCyclesUsingCollapsingPathGraphMethodology,
GetAllCyclicPaths, GetIndependentCyclicPaths, StringifyCyclesDetection

Cycles in a B<Graph> are detected using collapsing path graph [Ref 31]
methodology.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

    $NewCyclesDetection = new Graph::CyclesDetection($Graph);

Using specified I<Graph>, B<new> method creates a new B<CyclesDetection> object and returns
newly created B<CyclesDetection> object.

=item B<Copy>

    $NewCyclesDetection = $CyclesDetection->Copy();

Copies I<CyclesDetection> and its associated data using B<Storable::dclone> and returns a new
B<CyclesDetection> object.

=item B<DetectCycles>

    $CyclesDetection->DetectCycles();

Detects all cycles in a graph and returns I<CyclesDetection>.

=item B<DetectCyclesUsingCollapsingPathGraphMethodology>

    $CyclesDetection->DetectCyclesUsingCollapsingPathGraphMethodology();

Detects all cycles in a graph using collapsing path graph [Ref 31] methodology
and returns I<CyclesDetection>.

=item B<GetAllCyclicPaths>

    @AllCyclicPaths = $CyclesDetection->GetAllCyclicPaths();
    $NumOfAllCyclicPaths = $CyclesDetection->GetAllCyclicPaths();

Returns an array containing references to all cyclic paths identified during cycles
detection. In scalar text, number of cycles is returned.

=item B<GetIndependentCyclicPaths>

    @IndependentCyclicPaths = $CyclesDetection->GetAllCyclicPaths();
    $NumOfIndependentCyclicPaths = $CyclesDetection->GetAllCyclicPaths();

Returns an array containing references to independent cyclic paths identified during cycles
detection. In scalar text, number of cycles is returned.

A set of independent cycles identified during cycles detection doesn't correspond to the basis set of
rings or smallest set of smallest rings (SSSR) [ Refs 29-30 ]; instead, set of cycles indentified
as independent cycles simply correpond to cycles which contain no other cycle as their
subcycles and can't be described as a linear combination of smaller cycles. And it also happens
to contain all the rings in basis set of rings and SSSR. In other words, it's a superset of a basis set
of cycles and SSSR. For example, six four membered cycles are indentified for cubane, which is one
more than the basis set of cycles.

=item B<StringifyCyclesDetection>

    $String = $CyclesDetection->StringifyCyclesDetection();

Returns a string containing information about I<CyclesDetection> object.
