=head1 NAME

PathGraph

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Graph::PathGraph;

use Graph::PathGraph qw(:all);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<PathGraph> class provides the following methods:

new, CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths, DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan,
GetCyclicPaths, GetPaths, IsPathGraph, StringifyPathGraph

B<PathGraph> class is derived from I<Graph> class.

=head2 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

    $NewPathGraph = new Graph::PathGraph($Graph);

Using specified I<Graph>, B<new> method creates a new B<PathGraph> object and returns
newly created B<PathGraph> object.

I<Graph> is converted into a B<PathGraph> by copying all its vertices and edges without any
associated properties data and associating a I<Path> object to each edge containing edge
vertex IDs as intial path.

=item B<CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths>

    $PathGraph->CollapseVertexAndCollectCyclicPaths($VertexID);

Collapses paths around a I<VertexID> by updating paths around the vertex [Ref 31] and associating any
resulting cyclic paths to graph as B<CyclicPaths> property name. And returns I<PathGraph>.

=item B<DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan>

    $Return = $PathGraph->DeleteVerticesWithDegreeLessThan($Degree);

Deletes vertices with degree less than I<Degree> from I<PathGraph> and returns I<PathGraph>.

=item B<GetCyclicPaths>

    @CyclicPaths = $PathGraph->GetCyclicPaths();
    $NumOfPaths = $PathGraph->GetCyclicPaths();

Returns an array of cyclic I<Paths> associated with edges in I<PathGraph>. In scalar context, number
of cyclic paths is returned.

=item B<GetPaths>

    @Paths = $PathGraph->GetPaths();
    $NumOfPaths = $PathGraph->GetPaths();

Returns an array of I<Paths> associated with edges in I<PathGraph>. In scalar context, number
of paths is returned.

=item B<IsPathGraph>

    $Status = Graph::PathGraph::IsPathGraph($Object);

Returns 1 or 0 based on whether I<Object> is a B<PathGraph> object.

=item B<StringifyPathGraph>

    $String = $PathGraph->StringifyPathGraph();

Returns a string containing information about traversed paths in I<PathGraph> object.
