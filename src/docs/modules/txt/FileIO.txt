NAME
    FileIO

SYNOPSIS
    use FileIO::FileIO;

    use FileIO::FileIO qw(:all);

DESCRIPTION
    FIleIO class provides following methods:

    new, Close, Open, SetMode

    FleIO class serves as a base class for all classes involved in file IO.
    It is derived from ObjectProperty base class which provides methods not
    explicitly defined in Atom or ObjectProperty class using Perl's AUTOLOAD
    functionality. These methods are generated on-the-fly for a specified
    object property:

        Set<PropertyName>(<PropertyValue>);
        $PropertyValue = Get<PropertyName>();
        Delete<PropertyName>();

  METHODS
    new
            $NewFileIO = new FileIO(%NamesAndValues);

        Using specified *FileIO* property names and values hash, new method
        creates a new object and returns a reference to a newly created
        FileIO object. By default, the following properties are initialized:

            Name = '';
            Mode = 'Read';
            Status = 0;
            FileHandle = '';

    Close
            $FileIO->Close();

        Close open file and returns *FileIO*.

    Open
            $FileIO->Open();

        Opens the file using file *Name* and *Mode* and returns *FileIO*.

    SetMode
            $FileIO->SetMode($Mode);

        Sets up file *Mode* and returns *FileIO* Default *Mode* value:
        *Read*. Supported *Mode* values:

            Read, Write, Append, <, >, >>, r, w, a

    SetName
            $FileIO->SetName($Name);

        Sets up file *Name* and returns *FileIO*.
