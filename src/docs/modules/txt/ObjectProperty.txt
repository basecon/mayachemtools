NAME
    ObjectProperty

SYNOPSIS
    use ObjectProperty;

DESCRIPTION
    ObjectProperty is an abstract base class which implements methods not
    explicitly defined in classed derived from this class using Perl's
    AUTOLOAD functionality. These methods are generated on-the-fly for a
    specified object property:

        Set<PropertyName>(<PropertyValue>);
        $PropertyValue = Get<PropertyName>();
        Delete<PropertyName>();

    This class uses its parent class hash to set, get, and delete propery
    names and values.

    ObjectProperty module provides the following methods to be used in
    context of its parent class:

    DeleteProperty, GetProperty, HasProperty, SetProperties, SetProperty

            GetProperty($Name);

        Returns value associated with specified property *Name*.

    HasProperty
            HasProperty($Name);

        Returns 1 or 0 based on whether specified property *Name* associated
        with an object.

    SetProperties
            SetProperties(%NamesAndValues);

        Using specified property name and value hash *NamesAndValues*,
        associates each property *Name* and *Values* to an object.
