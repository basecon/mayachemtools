NAME
    PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py - Mutate amino acids

SYNOPSIS
    PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py [--mutations <Spec1,Spec2,...>] [--overwrite]
    [-w <dir>] -i <infile> -o <outfile>

    PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py -h | --help | -e | --examples

DESCRIPTION
    Mutate amino acids in macromolecules. The mutations are performed using
    protein mutagenesis wizard available in PyMOL.

    The supported input and output file format is: PDB (.pdb)

OPTIONS
    -m, --mutations <Spec1,Spec2,...> [default: None]
        Comma delimited list of specifications for mutating amino acid
        residues in proteins.

        The format of mutation specification is as follows:

            <ChainID>:<ResName><ResNum><ResName>,...

        A chain ID in the first specification of a mutation is required. It
        may be skipped in subsequent specifications. The most recent chain
        ID is used for the missing chain ID. The first reside name
        corresponds to the residue to be mutated. The second residue name
        represents the new residue. The residue number corresponds to the
        first residue name and must be present in the current chain.

        Examples:

            E:LEU49CYS, E:SER53TYR
            E:LEU49CYS, SER53TYR
            E:LEU49CYS, SER53TYR, I:TYR7SER, ILE11VAL

        The residue names must be valid amino acid names. No validation is
        performed before mutating residues via protein mutagenesis wizard
        available in PyMOL.

    -e, --examples
        Print examples.

    -h, --help
        Print this help message.

    -i, --infile <infile>
        Input file name.

    -o, --outfile <outfile>
        Output file name.

    --overwrite
        Overwrite existing files.

    -w, --workingdir <dir>
        Location of working directory which defaults to the current
        directory.

EXAMPLES
    To mutate a single residue in a specific chain and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py -m "I:TYR7SER" -i Sample3.pdb
          -o Sample3Out.pdb

    To mutate multiple residues in a single chain and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py -m "I:TYR7SER, ILE11VAL" -i Sample3.pdb
          -o Sample3Out.pdb

    To mutate multiple residues across multiple chains and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateAminoAcids.py -m "E:LEU49CYS,SER53TYR,I:TYR7SER,ILE11VAL"
          -i Sample3.pdb -o Sample3Out.pdb
