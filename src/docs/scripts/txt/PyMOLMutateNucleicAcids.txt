NAME
    PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py - Mutate nucleic acids

SYNOPSIS
    PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py [--mutations <Spec1,Spec2,...>] [--overwrite]
    [-w <dir>] -i <infile> -o <outfile>

    PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py -h | --help | -e | --examples

DESCRIPTION
    Mutate nucleic acids in macromolecules. The mutations are performed
    using nucleic acids mutagenesis wizard available in PyMOL starting V2.2.

    The supported input and output file format is: PDB (.pdb)

OPTIONS
    -m, --mutations <Spec1,Spec2,...> [default: None]
        Comma delimited list of specifications for mutating nucleic acids.

        The format of mutation specification is as follows:

            <ChainID>:<ResNum><BaseName>,...

        A chain ID in the first specification of a mutation is required. It
        may be skipped in subsequent specifications. The most recent chain
        ID is used for the missing chain ID. The residue number corresponds
        to the residue to be mutated and must be present in the current
        chain. The base name represents the new base.

        Examples:

            A:9Thy, A:10Thy
            A:9Thy,10Thy,11Thy
            A:9Thy,10Thy,B:5Ade,6Ade

        The base names must be valid for mutating nucleic acids. No
        validation validation is performed before mutating residues via
        nucleic acids mutagenesis wizard available in PyMOL. The current
        version of the wizard supports the following base names:

            Adenine, Ade
            Cytosine, Cyt
            Guanine, Gua
            Thymine, Thy
            Uracil, Ura

    -e, --examples
        Print examples.

    -h, --help
        Print this help message.

    -i, --infile <infile>
        Input file name.

    -o, --outfile <outfile>
        Output file name.

    --overwrite
        Overwrite existing files.

    -w, --workingdir <dir>
        Location of working directory which defaults to the current
        directory.

EXAMPLES
    To mutate a single residue in a specific chain and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py -m "A:9Thy" -i Sample9.pdb
          -o Sample9Out.pdb

    To mutate multiple residues in a single chain and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py -m "A:9Thy,10Thy,11Thy" -i Sample9.pdb
          -o Sample9Out.pdb

    To mutate multiple residues across multiple chains and write a PDB file,
    type:

        % PyMOLMutateNucleicAcids.py -m "A:9Thy,10Thy,B:5Ade,6Ade"
          -i Sample9.pdb -o Sample9Out.pdb
