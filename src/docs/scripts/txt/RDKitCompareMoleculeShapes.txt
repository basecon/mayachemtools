DESCRIPTION
    Compare shapes of molecules between a set of molecules in reference and
    probe input files. The molecules are aligned using either Open 3DAlign
    or Crippen Open 3DAlign before calculating shape Tanimoto and protrude
    distances.

    The supported input file formats are: Mol (.mol), SD (.sdf, .sd)

    The supported output file formats are: CSV (.csv), TSV (.tsv, .txt)

OPTIONS
    -a, --alignment <Open3A, CrippenOpen3A> [default: Open3A]
        Alignment methodology to use for aligning molecules before
        calculating Tanimoto and protrude shape distances. Possible values:
        Open3A or CrippenOpen3A. Open 3DAlign (Open3A) [ Ref 132 ] overlays
        molecules based on MMFF atom types and charges. Crippen Open 3DAlign
        (CrippenOpen3A) uses Crippen logP contributions to overlay
        molecules.

    -d, --distance <Tanimoto, Protrude, Both> [default: Both]
        Shape comparison distance to calculate for comparing shapes of
        molecules. Possible values: Tanimoto, Protrude, or Both. Shape
        Tanimoto distance takes the volume overlay into account during the
        calculation of distance. Shape protrude distance, however, focuses
        on the volume mismatch.

    --infileParams <Name,Value,...> [default: auto]
        A comma delimited list of parameter name and value pairs for reading
        molecules from files. The supported parameter names for different
        file formats, along with their default values, are shown below:

            SD, MOL: removeHydrogens,yes,sanitize,yes,strictParsing,yes

    --maxIters <number> [default: 50]
        Maximum number of iterations to perform for each molecule pair
        during alignment.

    -m, --mode <OneToOne, AllToAll, FirstToAll> [default: OneToOne]
        Specify how molecules are handled in reference and probe input files
        during comparison of shapes between reference and probe molecules.
        Possible values: OneToOne, AllToAll and AllToFirst. For OneToOne
        mode, the molecule shapes are calculated for each pair of molecules
        in the reference and probe file and the shape distances are written
        to the output file. For AllToAll mode, the shape distances are
        calculated for each reference molecule against all probe molecules.
        For FirstToAll mode, however, the shape distances are only
        calculated for the first reference molecule against all probe
        molecules.

    -e, --examples
        Print examples.

    -h, --help
        Print this help message.

    -p, --probefile <probefile>
        Probe input file name.

    -r, --reffile <reffile>
        Reference input file name.

    -o, --outfile <outfile>
        Output file name for writing out shape distances. Supported text
        file extensions: csv or tsv.

    --overwrite
        Overwrite existing files.

    -w, --workingdir <dir>
        Location of working directory which defaults to the current
        directory.

EXAMPLES
    To perform shape alignment using Open3A methodology between pair of
    molecules in reference and probe input in 3D SD files, calculate both
    Tanimoto and protrude distances, and write out a CSV file containing
    calculated distance values along with appropriate molecule IDs, type:

        % RDKitCompareMoleculeShapes.py  -r Sample3DRef.sdf -p Sample3DProb.sdf
          -o SampleOut.csv

    To perform shape alignment using Crippen Open3A methodology between all
    molecules in reference and probe molecules in 3D SD files, calculate
    only Tanimoto distance, and write out a TSV file containing calculated
    distance value along with appropriate molecule IDs, type:

        % RDKitCompareMoleculeShapes.py  -m AllToAll -a CrippenOpen3A -d Tanimoto
          -r Sample3DRef.sdf -p Sample3DProb.sdf -o SampleOut.csv

    To perform shape alignment using Open3A methodology between first
    reference molecule against all probe molecules in 3D SD files without
    removing hydrogens , calculate both Tanimoto and protrude distances, and
    write out a CSV file containing calculated distance values along with
    appropriate molecule IDs, type:

        % RDKitCompareMoleculeShapes.py -m FirstToAll -a Open3A -d Both 
          --infileParams "removeHydrogens,no" -r Sample3DRef.sdf
          -p Sample3DProb.sdf -o SampleOut.csv
