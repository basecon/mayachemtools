DESCRIPTION
    Extract specific data from *SequenceFile(s) and AlignmentFile(s)* and
    generate FASTA files. You can extract sequences using sequence IDs or
    sequence numbers.

    The file names are separated by spaces. All the sequence files in a
    current directory can be specified by **.aln*, **.msf*, **.fasta*,
    **.fta*, **.pir* or any other supported formats; additionally, *DirName*
    corresponds to all the sequence files in the current directory with any
    of the supported file extension: *.aln, .msf, .fasta, .fta, and .pir*.

    Supported sequence formats are: *ALN/CLustalW*, *GCG/MSF*, *PILEUP/MSF*,
    *Pearson/FASTA*, and *NBRF/PIR*. Instead of using file extensions, file
    formats are detected by parsing the contents of *SequenceFile(s) and
    AlignmentFile(s)*.

OPTIONS
    -h, --help
        Print this help message.

    -i, --IgnoreGaps *yes | no*
        Ignore gaps or gap columns during during generation of new sequence
        or alignment file(s). Possible values: *yes or no*. Default value:
        *yes*.

        In order to remove gap columns, length of all the sequence must be
        same; otherwise, this option is ignored.

    -m, --mode *SequenceID | SequenceNum | SequenceNumRange*
        Specify how to extract data from sequence files: extract sequences
        using sequence IDs or sequence numbers. Possible values: *SequenceID
        | SequenceNum | SequenceNumRange*. Default: *SequenceNum* with value
        of 1.

        The sequence numbers correspond to position of sequences starting
        from 1 for first sequence in *SequenceFile(s) and AlignmentFile(s)*.

    -o, --overwrite
        Overwrite existing files.

    -r, --root *rootname*
        New sequence file name is generated using the root:
        <Root><Mode>.<Ext>. Default new file:
        <SequenceFileName><Mode>.<Ext>. This option is ignored for multiple
        input files.

    -s, --Sequences *"SequenceID,[SequenceID,...]" |
    "SequenceNum,[SequenceNum,...]" | "StartingSeqNum,EndingSeqNum"*
        This value is -m, --mode specific. In general, it's a comma
        delimites list of sequence IDs or sequence numbers.

        For *SequenceID* value of -m, --mode option, input value format is:
        *SequenceID,...*. Examples:

            ACHE_BOVIN
            ACHE_BOVIN,ACHE_HUMAN

        For *SequenceNum* value of -m, --mode option, input value format is:
        *SequenceNum,...*. Examples:

            2
            1,5

        For *SequenceNum* value of -m, --mode option, input value format is:
        *StaringSeqNum,EndingSeqNum*. Examples:

            2,4

    --SequenceIDMatch *Exact | Relaxed*
        Sequence IDs matching criterion during *SequenceID* value of -m,
        --mode option: match specified sequence ID exactly or as sub string
        against sequence IDs in the files. Possible values: *Exact |
        Relaxed*. Default: *Relaxed*. Sequence ID match is case insenstitive
        during both options.

    --SequenceLength *number*
        Maximum sequence length per line in sequence file(s). Default: *80*.

    -w --WorkingDir *text*
        Location of working directory. Default: current directory.

EXAMPLES
    To extract first sequence from Sample1.fasta sequence file and generate
    Sample1SequenceNum.fasta sequence file, type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl -o Sample1.fasta

    To extract first sequence from Sample1.aln alignment file and generate
    Sample1SequenceNum.fasta sequence file without any column gaps, type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl -o Sample1.aln

    To extract first sequence from Sample1.aln alignment file and generate
    Sample1SequenceNum.fasta sequence file with column gaps, type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl --IgnroreGaps No -o Sample1.aln

    To extract sequence number 1 and 4 from Sample1.fasta sequence file and
    generate Sample1SequenceNum.fasta sequence file, type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl -o -m SequenceNum --Sequences 1,4
          -o Sample1.fasta

    To extract sequences from sequence number 1 to 4 from Sample1.fasta
    sequence file and generate Sample1SequenceNumRange.fasta sequence file,
    type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl -o -m SequenceNumRange --Sequences
          1,4 -o Sample1.fasta

    To extract sequence ID "Q9P993/104-387" from sequence from Sample1.fasta
    sequence file and generate Sample1SequenceID.fasta sequence file, type:

        % ExtractFromSequenceFiles.pl -o -m SequenceID --Sequences
          "Q9P993/104-387" --SequenceIDMatch Exact -o Sample1.fasta
